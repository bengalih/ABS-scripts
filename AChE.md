## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

```bash
python ache.py 
```

## üìÇ Output

On first run the export and import folder will be created.
Search for a book (usually via Title or ASIN) and the chapter list will be downloaded to the export folder.
You can edit directly with an editor of your choice and then immediately upload it.
Alternatively, you can move it to the import folder and on next run it will be validated for importation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è File Structure

The script exports chapter files with a header in the format:

<pre>
# Title: The Metamorphosis
# Author: Franz Kafka
# Item ID: 6142c810-72e2-4bb2-a18e-115aa8342632
# ASIN: B004Y0K5V6
# ISBN: None
</pre>

Only the `Item ID` header line is required when importing, the rest are informational.
You can create your own files for import as long as they have the `Item ID` header line and are in the proper TAB separated format.
.CUE file format is also supported, but you must add the header line to the top of the .CUE file.

The script requires, and only matches on, `Item ID` as it is the only unique field to ensure no conflicts.

The easiest ways to find the `Item ID` are:

- Export the chapters and grab the header line.
- Open for the book in ABS and the URL will display the `Item ID`:
  
  audiobookshelf.mydomain.com/audiobookshelf/item/**bbb7c502-e262-4e8b-b8de-503da6d93a71**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Editors

When downloading a chapter list, you can press (E) to edit the file immediately.
This will open up the user configured editor program and pass the filename.
Sending this to an editor which supports TAB separated fields, like Excel, will allow you to past in a column for just the chapters without modifying the times.
If your editor locks the file down, be sure to close it before trying to over-write.

You can choose not to use the (E)dit function and simply open the file through other means, edit, and upload.
You can also edit it later and put it in the import directory for parsing on next run.
